# What is Dynamic Programming?
Dynamic programming refers to a class of problem solving techniques (another you have heard of is 'divide and conquer') which tries to break up a problem into subproblems and as these subproblems are solved, their values are used to construct the final solution as well as re-used to avoid unecessary computation. This is often a new way to solve problem to students so examples are very handy to understand DP. In later courses, you may revisit dynamic programming and specifically study what is called "the optimality" of a solution. 

For now, let's look at a first and familiar example:
