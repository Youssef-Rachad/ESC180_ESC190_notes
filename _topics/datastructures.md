In this section, we will tentatively cover:

- Data Sctructures vs. Abstract Data Types
- Linked Lists (the subfields here are repeatable for every topic)
  - Operations for linked lists
  - Python vs. C implementations
  - Variants on linked lists
  - Complexity of Operations Defined
- Stacks
- Queues
  - Implementing a Queue using an Array or using a Linked List
- Priority Queues
  - Implementation using Arrays (naive approach) 
  - Implementation using Heaps
- Graphs
  - Classification of Graphs
  - Adjacency List Implementation
  - Adjacency Matrix Implementation
- Hash Tables
  - Hash Mappings
  - Collision Handling
