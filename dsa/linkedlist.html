                <h1>Linked Lists</h1>
                <!-- Motivation -->
                <p>Motivation: We cannot dynamically add an element to an existing array or block of memory easily, as
                    there could be no space there! The only option we have is to re-allocate everything to a new
                    location
                    with enough space. This is inefficient, especially for larger arrays. Instead, we can use a special
                    data
                    structure called a <b>linked list</b>.</p>
                <!-- ADT implementation of list -->
                <p>Linked lists are in fact a data structure which implement the list abstract data type (<a
                        href="./adt.html">ADT</a>).
                    A <code>list</code> is an ordered collection of data items that supports the
                    following operations:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Insert(list, i, x)</code>: add item <code>x</code> at index <code>i</code> of
                        <code>list</code>. The item previously at index <code>i</code>, and all following items, are
                        shifted up by one index to make room for <code>x</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>Remove(list, i)</code>: remove item at index <code>i</code> of <code>list</code>. The item
                        previously at index <code>i+1</code>, and all following items, are shifted down by one index to
                        fill the gap.</li>
                    <li><code>Get(list, i)</code>: return the item at index <code>i</code> of <code>list</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <!-- ruh roh we need to define lists, maybe in ADT directly?? -->We define this ADT very abstractly,
                such that we only describe the outcome of each operation, but not
                how to implement it. For example, lists can be implemented using arrays, but it can also be implemented
                using linked lists.

                <!-- What is a linked list -->
                <p>A linked list consists of a data structure called a <code>node</code>, which consists of the
                    following information:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>data:</code> the actual data you need to store</li>
                    <li><code>next:</code> the address of the next node</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>We can then make an array by creating a chain of these nodes, where we can find the next node by
                    following the <code>next</code> pointer. While this uses up more space than a regular array, it
                    has the benefit of preventing re-allocating everything. For example, if we want to add an
                    element to the end of the list, we can simply create a new node and set the <code>next</code>
                    pointer of the last node to point to the new node (+ a minor detail we'll touch on in a bit).
                </p>
                <p>See the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/190/lec/W07/LL.pdf">lecture slides</a> for a
                    visual of linked lists and their operations.</p>

                <h2 id="L18-LL-operations">Linked List Operations</h2>
                We want to implement the following operations: Inserting, Removing, and Searching.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <li>
                    <li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In summary, we can delete and insert nodes in constant time, which is faster than array operations which
                are O(n). However, getting the <code>i</code>th node is linear time, while we can do that in constant
                time for arrays.

                <h1>Implementation in C</h1>
                <h2>Insert Operation</h2>
                Inserting: Suppose we already have a pointer to a node, and we wish to insert a node after that.
                        What we can do is create this new node, and set its <code>next</code> pointer to point to the
                        node that the original node pointed to. Then, we can set the original node's <code>next</code>
                        pointer to point to the new node we just created.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Analogy:</b> A popular children's activity is to form a <i>human train,</i> where each
                            person puts their hand on the shoulder of the person in front of them, forming a chain
                            (linked list). If a new participant Bob (the new node) wants to join the train in front of
                            Alice (who is holding Carol's shoulder), Bob can do so by holding onto Carol's shoulder, and
                            then Alice can hold onto Bob's shoulder. </li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Get Operation</h2>
                Getting: Suppose we wish to find a node (i.e. its pointer) at a certain index (i.e. the
                        <code>i</code>th node) In the previous 2 operations, we assumed we already had this pointer. We
                        can do so by iterating through the linked list by following the <code>next</code> pointer until
                        we find the node we want.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Analogy:</b> If a teacher wants to find the 7th student, they can start from the very
                            beginning of the train and follow it to the end until the 7th student is found.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Remove Operation</h2>
                Removing: Suppose we already have a pointer to a node, and we wish to delete that node. We can
                        do so by setting the <code>next</code> pointer of the node before the node we want to delete to
                        point to the node after the node we want to delete. Finally, we free up the memory.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Analogy:</b> If Bob wants to leave the train, he can simply let go of Carol's shoulder,
                            and Alice can hold onto Carol's shoulder. </li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 id="L18-LL-implementation">Linked List Implementation</h2>
                We can implement the linked list as follows:
                <pre><code class="c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt
#include &lt;string.h&gt
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt

typedef struct node{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
} node;

typedef struct LL{
    node *head;
    int size;
} LL;

void create_node(node **p_n, int data)
{
    *p_n = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));
    (*p_n)->data = data;
    (*p_n)->next = NULL;
}


void create_LL_from_data(LL **p_LL, int *data_arr, int size)
{
    (*p_LL) = (LL*)malloc(sizeof(LL));
    (*p_LL)->size = 0; // initialize size to 0
    
    // keep track of the last node of the linked list
    node *tail = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){

        // n is a pointer to a node with data = data[i], next = NULL
        node *n;
        create_node(&n, data_arr[i]);

        // If the last node is the 1st node
        if(tail == 0){
            (*p_LL)->head = n;
        }

        // If the last node is not the 1st node
        else{
            // append the new node to the end of the linked list
            tail->next = n;
        }

        // update the tail
        tail = n;

        // update the size
        (*p_LL)->size++;
    }
}

int main(){
    int data_arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    LL *p_LL;
    create_LL_from_data(&p_LL, data_arr, 5);
}</code></pre>
                Here are some observations:
                <ul>
                    <li>The idea behind the <code>create_LL_from_data</code> function is to keep track of the last node
                        of the linked list (known as the tail) and constantly update it such that every time we create a
                        new node, the tail's <code>next</code> pointer points to the new node. </li>
                    <li>Initializing a new node like <code>node *n</code> will cause the <code>next</code> pointer to be
                        <code>0</code> i.e. <code>NULL</code>. This is how we can tell we reached the end of a linked
                        list.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>we need to use pointers to pointers because we want to be able to modify the value of the
                        <code>LL</code> pointer (i.e. the memory address it points to), rather than just the value of
                        the data it points to.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="L19-LL-insert">Insert for Linked List</h2>
                In the previous lecture, we defined the linked list struct as follows:
                <pre><code class="c">typedef struct node{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
} node;

typedef struct LL{
  node *head;
  int size;
} LL;
</code></pre>
                We also talked about how to implement insertions conceptually. We can implement it as follows:
                <pre><code class="c">
void LL_insert(LL *my_list, int new_elem, int index)
{
  // Create the new node 
  node *n;
  create_node(&n, new_elem);

  // If the list is empty
  if(my_list->head == NULL){
    my_list->head = n;
    my_list->size++;
    return;
  }

  // To insert at the very beginning
  if(index == 0){
    n->next = my_list->head;
    my_list->head = n;
    my_list->size++;
    return;
  }

  // Errors
  if (index < 0 || index > my_list->size-1){
    fprintf(stderr, "Invalid index %d", index);
    exit(1); // exits the program, returns 1 to the OS
  }

  // Traverse to the desired index
  node *cur = my_list->head;
  for(int i = 0; i < index; i++){
    cur = cur->next;
  }

  n->next = cur->next;
  cur->next = n;
  my_list->size++;
}
</code></pre>
                Note that we deal with a few edge cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the list is empty, which we can check if the head is <code>NULL</code>, then we proceed to
                        make the new node the first (and only) element of the linked list.</li>
                    <li>We want to implement it such that inserting it at index <code>0</code> corresponds to inserting
                        it at the very beginning. To do this, not only do we need to update the <code>next</code>
                        pointer of the new node, but the <code>head</code> pointer of our linked list. The order here is
                        important. If we instead ran <code>my_list->head = n;</code> first, we lose information on where
                        the original head is located.</li>
                    <li>If the index is invalid, there are a few possibilities of what we can do.<ol>
                            <li>Just Crash: Sometimes this is a good idea, if we are trying to optimize the code. It's
                                on the user to give valid parameters.</li>
                            <li>Don't crash and don't insert. Instead, set a global variable to indicate an error. The
                                reason we need a global variable here is that there's no other thing we can return that
                                will indicate this. For example, if we are trying to return the element at an invalid
                                index, a naive idea would be to return something like <code>-1</code> or
                                <code>"Error"</code>, but how do we know that this is actually an error and their list
                                doesn't actually include this!
                            </li>
                            <li>Print an error message. In particular the best way to print an error is using
                                <code>fprintf(stderr, "message")</code> because it prints to the standard error stream,
                                which is different from the standard output stream. Unlike <code>printf</code> (which
                                sometimes doesn't show in terminal), this will always show, and allows regular print
                                statements and error messages to be separated.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                In the other cases, we first need to traverse to the desired index. Because this is not an array, we
                need to follow the linked list via the <code>next</code> pointers. Once we reach the desired index, we
                can update the <code>next</code> pointers of the new node and the node before it. Similar to above, the
                order of updating the <code>next</code> pointers matter!
                <h2 id="L19-LL-remove">Remove and Get for Linked List</h2>
                The code to remove and get for linked lists can be found <a
                    href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/190/labs/linkedlist.c">here</a> and is very similar to
                the code for insert. For deletion, we just need to remember to update the <code>next</code> pointer of
                the node before the one we are deleting, and freeing up the memory. Like most cases, the order here is
                important.

                Getting is actually partially implemented in insertion and deletion, as we need to find the
                <code>i</code>th element. Error handling for all three functions are also similar.
                <h2 id="L19-Coding-Practices">Good Coding Practices</h2>
                Suppose you have a piece of code, that relies on an abstract data structure (i.e. a list). We can define
                this structure in a header file <a
                    href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/190/labs/list.h">list.h</a>. Recall that an ADT doesn't
                include how it is implemented, just the operations. <br><br>

                We can now implement this ADT in a separate file. For example, we can either implement it using <a
                    href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/190/labs/linkedlist.c">linkedlist.c</a> or <a
                    href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/190/labs/arraylist.c">arraylist.c</a>. For example, if
                our <code>list.h</code> file looks like
                <pre><code class="c">#if !defined(LIST_H)
#define LIST_H
void create_list_from_data(void **p_list, int *data_arr, int size);
void list_append(void *list, int new_elem);
void list_insert(void *list, int new_elem, int index);
void list_delete(void *list, int index);
void list_free_all(void *list);
int list_get(void *list, int index);
#endif</code></pre> Then our <code>linkedlist.c</code> file needs to contain these functions. If we already have code
                (i.e. the earlier ones we wrote), we don't need to modify them. Instead, we can just create a new
                function that calls them in order to have the right form. For example,
                <pre><code class="c">void list_insert(void *list, int new_elem, int index)
{
    LL_insert((LL*)list, new_elem, index);
}

int list_get(void *list, int index)
{
    return LL_get(list, index);
}</code></pre>
                Notice that the functions in <code>list.h</code> take in void pointers, because we want them to be as
                general as possible (i.e. could be implemented using either an array or linked list). These additional
                functions we write in <code>linkedlist.c</code> are just wrappers. One final note is that although we
                can cast the void pointer to the correct type <code>(LL*)</code>, it is not necessary.<br><br>

                We can do this for both <code>linkedlist.c</code> and <code>arraylist.c</code>, and when we want to
                compile our main program, we can choose to compile it with either <code>linkedlist.c</code> or
                <code>arraylist.c</code>. For example, we can run
                <pre><code class="language-bash">gcc linkedlist.c -c -o linkedlist.o</code></pre>
                to create the object file <code>linkedlist.o</code>. We can then compile <code>main.c</code> alongside
                <code>linkedlist.o</code> to create an executable. We can do this by running
                <pre><code class="language-bash">gcc main.c linkedlist.o -o main</code></pre>
                If we instead wanted to compile using the array list implementation, we can run
                <pre><code class="language-bash">gcc main.c arraylist.o -o main</code></pre>
                This has several advantages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Modularity and Reusability: When writing our main code, we don't have to worry about how certain
                        functions are implemented. Also, if we already have code that can implement abstract data
                        structures, we can just re-use them for future projects without changing too much!</li>
                    <li>Faster compilation: Using a precompiled object like <code>linkedlist.o</code> can save
                        compilation time. Although this is not a big problem now, compilation time can be an issue for
                        larger and more complex projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 id="L21">L21: Linked Lists II</h1>
                In this lecture, we will discuss how to implement a linked list in Python. Most of the time, you won't
                need to use a linked list in Python (we'll see an example next Monday), but it is still important to
                understand how linked lists work, and the work done in this lecture will be useful for implementing
                other data structures in Python for the rest of this course. The advantage of Python over C is
                pedagogical here, we want to focus on the data structure and not the specific implementation
                details.<br><br>

                If you are not familiar with classes, please see the last part of L19. Consider the Node class,
                <pre><code class="python">class Node:
  def __init__(self, value):
      self.value = value
      self.next = None
  
  def __str__(self):
      return f"{self.value}"</code></pre>
                By default, we have set <code>self.next = None</code> to indicate that the next node is not yet defined.
                We can then create a linked list by creating a series of nodes and linking them together. For example,
                <pre><code class="python">if __name__ == '__main__':
  n1 = Node(12)
  n2 = Node(15)
  n3 = Node(500)

  n1.next = n2
  n2.next = n3</code></pre>
                Recall that in the Python memory model, values are not copied. Everything is passed by reference.
                Therefore, something like <code>n1.next = n2</code> means we make <code>n1.next</code> refer to the
                address of <code>n2</code> (so they are treated as the "same" thing). In C, the analogy would be
                <pre><code class="c">node *n1 = create_node(12)
node *n2 = create_node(15)
n1->next = n2;
</pre></code>
                where the function <code>create_node()</code> performs the memory allocation for you, which is what
                Python is doing behind the scenes. We can also make a linked list class and include some functions. For
                example,
                <pre><code class="python">class LinkedList:
  def __init__(self):
      self.head = None
  
  def get_i(self, i):
      # return the value at index i
      cur = self.head
      for j in range(i):
          cur = cur.next
      return cur.value

  def append(self, value):
      '''Add a new node with the value value to the end of the list'''
      # Create a new node
      new_node = Node(value)
      print(new_node)

      if self.head == None:
          self.head = new_node
      else:
          # Find the last node
          cur = self.head
          while cur.next != None:
              cur = cur.next
          cur.next = new_node
  
  def insert(self, value, i):
      '''Insert a node with the value value at index i'''
      new_node = Node(value)

      if i == 0:
          new_node.next = self.head
          self.head = new_node
      else:
          cur = self.head
          for j in range(i-1):
              cur = cur.next
          new_node.next = cur.next
          cur.next = new_node

  def __str__(self):
      cur = self.head
      s = ""
      if(cur == None):
          return "Empty list :("
      
      while cur != None:
          s += str(cur) + " -> "
          cur = cur.next
      return s[:-4] # remove last arrow</code></pre>
                Note that we didn't do anything new here. We took the existing code we had in L18 and transformed it
                into Python equivalents. The only new thing is the <code>__str__</code> function, which allows us to
                easily print out the linked list. For this function we have two cases: if the list is empty, we print
                something, and if the list is non-empty we print out the values of each node, connected with the ->
                symbol. We can then test our code,
                <pre><code class="python">if __name__ == '__main__':
  LL = LinkedList()
  LL.append(3)
  LL.append(50)
  LL.append(100)

  print(LL)</code></pre>
