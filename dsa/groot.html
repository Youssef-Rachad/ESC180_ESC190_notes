                <h1 id="LDynamicStrings">Trees</h1>
                <!--There's a weird relationship here, a BST is a tree which is a graph. 
                    So to an array or a ll it's an ADT but do a set it's a datastructure-->
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                Trees are a special case of <a href="./graph.html">graphs</a> where a hierarchy is clearly established between the nodes.
                The first node is called the <code>root node</code> and is the point at which the graph "starts" meaning no other node points to it.
                The root node points down to one or more <code>child nodes</code> and these nodes then point down to their own child nodes. 
                When a node points to another, we call it its <code>parent node</code>. 
                One last term: a leaf node is any node that has no children (remember trees are upside down in computer science).
                
                Let's focus on more special cases: 
                <ol>
                    <li>A <code>binary tree</code> is a tree in which each node has <b>at most 2 children</b>.</li>
                    <li>A <code>binary search tree (BST)</code> is a binary tree in which the left child is always smaller and the right child is always bigger for any node in the tree.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <em>Binary trees don't need to have 2 children for every node, but when they do they're called <code>complete trees</code></em>
                <h2>Implementation in Python</h2>
                Let's look at how to implement a binary search tree. We will start by implementing a binary tree.

                <pre><code class="python"># Recall the class definition of a Node 
class Node:
  def __init__(self, key):
    self.left  = None 
    self.right = None
    self.val   = key 

def make_tree():
  root = Node(1)  # Creating the tree starts by defining the root node 
  root.left = Node(2)
  root.right = Node(3)
  root.left.left = Node(4)
  root.left.right = Node(5)
  
  return root

# We get a tree that looks like 
#      1
#     / \
#    2   3 
#   / \
#  4   5
                </code></pre>
                The above code gets us a binary tree; notice that we defined our <code>Node</code> class to only support 2 children at most.
                We will rewrite <code>make_tree()</code> to instead give us a BST (to convert any binary tree into a BST we need to study heapify)
                <pre><code class="python"># Recall the class definition of a Node 
class Node:
  def __init__(self, key):
    self.left  = None 
    self.right = None
    self.val   = key 

def make_tree():
  root = Node(3)  # Creating the tree starts by defining the root node 
  root.left = Node(1) # Remember left children are smaller
  root.right = Node(5) # right children are bigger 
  root.left.left = Node(0)
  root.left.right = Node(2)
  
  return root

# We get a tree that looks like 
#      3
#     / \
#    1   5 
#   / \
#  0   2
                </code></pre>
                Now if we want to search for a value in our BST we can start at the root node and compare its value against our target value.
                There are 3 cases:
                <ol>
                    <li>The current value is equal to our target, we found the node we are looking for and can stop the search.</li>
                    <li>The current value is smaller: we continue exploring the left sub-tree.</li>
                    <li>The current value is larger: we continue exploring the right sub-tree.</li>
                </ol>
<pre><code class="python">def search_BST(root, key):
    # root is the root node of a BST, key is the target value 
    # return True if the key is present in the BST 
    if root is None:
      return False                   # The BST (or sub-tree) is empty, no more nodes left to explore
    elif root.val == key:
      return True                    # We found the value!
    elif key &lt; root.val: 
      return search(root.left, key)  # Explore the left sub-tree 
    else:
      return search(root.right, key) # Explore the right sub-tree
</code></pre>
Notice this implementation makes healthy use of recursion because we can break down the problem and address it one node at a time.
