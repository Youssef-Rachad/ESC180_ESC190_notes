                <h1 id="graphs">Graph Traversal and Integration</h1>
                When solving an involved integral, we can consider multiple approaches among u-substitution, trigonometric substitution, integration by parts and Weistrass substitution which are covered in first year calculus.
                We can represent this problem as a graph traversal problem by creating a tree where the root node is the initial integral and each leaf represents a technique integration 
                (subsequent leaves will represent the steps taken to solve the integral using the respective technique).
                An overview of such tree reveals that some methods are long winded, others do not yield the answer at all and a few (usually one) quickly lead to an answer.
                Note that we have covered DFS and BFS:
                <ul>
                  <li>DFS implies trying each integration technique sequentially and seeing it through to completion.</li>
                  <li>BFS implies trying to set up each integration technique then making 1 step progress on each technique until a solution is found (effectively doing the work n-times).</li>
                </ul>
               This is obviously non-representative of how we typically solve integrals (especially under time pressure).
               Instead a guided search is conducted by selecting a technique and working it through enough to determine whether the approach considered is viable.
               If the chosen technique doesn't look promising, we can end the exploration early and move onto the next technique.
               What is difficult to determine programmatically is the heuristic that describes the difficulty of an integral.

              Consider the following example:
              \[\int\sec(x)\mathrm{dx}\]
              You should verify that the indefinite integral solves to 
              \[\ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C\]
