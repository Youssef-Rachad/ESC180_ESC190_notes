<h2>Abstract DataType</h2>
An abstract data type is a theoretical concept that defines a set of data and operations that can be performed on the data WITHOUT dictating an implementation.
The focus is put on the logical description and manipulation and as a result, ADTs are used as guidelines to implement data structures.

<h2>Data Structure</h2>
A data structure is an implementation of an ADT with well-defined runtime and memory complexities.
A data structure is a piece of code which achieves the requirements set out by its corresponding ADT and sometimes applies additional constraints to influence the complexities of the operations it implements.

<h2>Distinguishing the Two</h2>
It can be easy to confuse ADTs and data structures.
A good rule of thumb goes as follows: if it’s an idea you can visualise or draw then it’s an ADT; if it’s a piece of code you can implement and compute runtime/memory complexity then it’s a data structure.
