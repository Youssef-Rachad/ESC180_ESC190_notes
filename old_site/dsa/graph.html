                <h1 id="Graph">Graphs</h1>
                Graphs can be viewed as very general trees! In fact, a linked-list is a special case of a graph; one
                where each node has 2 directed edges (except for the root and tail nodes of course.)
                <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><br>
                    A <b>graph</b> \(G=(V,E)\) consists of a set of vertices (nodes) \(V\) and a set of edges \(E\).
                </div>
                Is a graph an ADT or a data structure? Well, there isn't a prescribed way to implement a graph so it
                must be an ADT. We will see how to implement a graph shortly, in the meantime think about how you would
                do so (in Python for example).

                For example, the following is a graph,
                <center>
                    <script type="text/tikz">
                      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
                            \tikzstyle{vertex}=[circle,fill=black!25,minimum size=40pt,inner sep=2pt]
                            \node[vertex] (G_1) at (-1,1)  {\(V_1\)};
                            \node[vertex] (G_2) at (0,0)  {\(V_2\)};
                            \node[vertex] (G_3) at (-2,-.5)  {\(V_3\)};
                            \node[vertex] (G_4) at (0,-1) {\(V_4\)};
                            \node[vertex] (G_5) at (-1.5,-1.5) {\(V_5\)};

                            \draw (G_1) -- node[midway, above, font=\Large] {\(e_1\)} (G_2);
                            \draw (G_2) -- node[midway, above, font=\Large] {\(e_2\)} (G_3);
                            \draw (G_2) -- node[midway, right, font=\Large] {\(e_3\)} (G_4);
                            \draw (G_5) -- node[midway, right, font=\Large] {\(e_4\)} (G_3);
                        \end{tikzpicture}
                      </script>
                </center>
                where
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                G &= (V,E) \\
                V &= \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\} \\
                E &= \{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\} \\
                e_1 &= (v_1, v_2) \\
                e_2 &= (v_2, v_3) \\
                e_3 &= (v_2, v_4) \\
                e_4 &= (v_3, v_5)
                \end{align*}
                \]

                Here, the edges can either be undirected or directed. If no arrows are drawn, we assume the edges are
                undirected
                (so we can travel from \(v_1\) to \(v_2\) and from \(v_2\) to \(v_1\)) and we treat \((v_1,v_2)\) as an
                unordered pair.<br><br>

                Why might we use graphs?
                <ul>
                    <li>Vertices are cities, edges are direct flights between cities: Want to find the best route
                        between cities
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reformulate: Find the shortest distance between two nodes on a graph</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Vertices are school classes, edges connect classes whose schedules overlap: Want to find
                        scheduling
                        times/locations for classes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reformulate: Find a set of nodes that are completely disconnected from each other (i.e. no
                            two nodes
                            share an edge)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Vertices are objects in memory, edges connect objects that refer to each other: Want to know
                        when an
                        object can be freed
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reformulate: Find the set of nodes that connect to a certain node</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                as just a few examples. The reason this is important is that there are already standard algorithms for
                dealing
                with these types of problems, so if we can take our problem and reformulate it as a graph problem, we
                automatically get the solution. Some different types of graphs:

                    Here, we write \(e_1 = (v_2,v_1)\) where the order matters now. The first element is the predecessor
                    (or
                    source) and the second element is the successor (or target).

                and some terminology:
                <ul>
                    <li>Vertex \(v_1\) is <b>adjacent</b> to vertex \(v_2\) if an edge connects them.</li>
                    <li>A <b>path</b> is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. The length of the path is
                        the
                        number of <i>edges</i> in it</li>
                    <li>A <b>cycle</b> is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex</li>
                    <li>A graph with no cycles is called a <b>acyclic graph</b></li>

                    <li>
                        A <b>simple cycle</b> is a cycle that does not contain any repeated vertices (except for the
                        first and
                        last vertex)
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        A subset of vertices is a <b>connected component</b> if every pair of vertices in the subset is

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>degree</b> of vertex \(v\) is the number of edges that connect to it

                </ul>
                This may seem like a lot to take in but most of these definitions are what you would expect them to be
                naturally.

                <h2>Datastructure Implementations</h2>
                There are 2 common ways to implement a graph:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We can use a <b>Adjacency Matrix</b>, which is a \(n\times n\) matrix where \(\verb#M[i][j]=1#\)
                        if
                        there is an edge between vertex \(i\) and vertex \(j\), and \(\verb#M[i][j]=0#\) otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can use an <b>Adjacency List</b>, which is a list of lists where \(\verb#L[i]#\) is a list of
                        all the
                        vertices that are adjacent to vertex \(i\).
                        Note here that we do not specify how lists are implemented immediately and in fact we will see
                        them
                        implemented using arrays and using linked lists.
                        Such is the joy of ADTs!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Adjacency List Implementation</h1>
                <h3>Arrays</h3>
                We can implement an adjacency list in Python as follows:
                <pre><code class="python">class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.adjacent = []

node1 = Node('A')
node2 = Node('B')
node3 = Node('C')

node1.adjacent.append(node2)
node1.adjacent.append(node3)
node2.adjacent.append(node1)
node3.adjacent.append(node1)
</code></pre>
                which gives the following graph:
                <br><br>
                <center>
                    <script type="text/tikz">
        \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
        \tikzstyle{vertex}=[circle,fill=black!25,minimum size=40pt,inner sep=2pt]
        \node[vertex] (G_1) at (0,2)  {A};
        \node[vertex] (G_2) at (0.7,1)  {B};
        \node[vertex] (G_3) at (-0.7,1)  {C};

        \draw (G_1) -- (G_2);
        \draw (G_1) -- (G_3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
      </script>
                </center>
                For an undirected graph, if there are \(N\) edges, then the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency
                lists is
                \(2N\).
                <h3>Linked Lists</h3>
                We can also implement an adjacency list with linked lists.
                <pre><code class="python">class Graph:
    def __init__(self, data):
        
</code></pre>
                <center>

                accessing the neighbours is very straightforward.

                <h1>Adjacency Matrix Implementation</h1>
                Recall this simple graph:
                <script type="text/tikz">
                    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
                    \tikzstyle{vertex}=[circle,fill=black!25,minimum size=40pt,inner sep=2pt]
                    \node[vertex] (G_1) at (0,2)  {A};
                    \node[vertex] (G_2) at (0.7,1)  {B};
                    \node[vertex] (G_3) at (-0.7,1)  {C};
            
                    \draw (G_1) -- (G_2);
                    \draw (G_1) -- (G_3);
                    \end{tikzpicture}
                  </script>
                We can implement an adjacency matrix in Python by defining the following <i>symmetric</i> matrix (for
                undirected graphs) with \(0\)s on the diagonal:
                \[
                A = \begin{pmatrix}
                0 & 1 & 1 \\
                1 & 0 & 0 \\
                1 & 0 & 0
                \end{pmatrix}
                \]
                where we have labelled \(\verb#A#\) as node 1, \(\verb#B#\) as node 2, and \(\verb#C#\) as
                node 3. Then the entry \(A_{ij}\) is 1 if there is an edge starting at node \(i\) and ending at node
                \(j\). Recall from linear algebra that \(A_{ij}\) refers to the element in the \(i\)th row and \(j\)th
                column of the matrix \(A\).<br><br>

                accessing the neighbours is very straightforward.

                Using an adjacency matrix versus an adjacency matrix has certain trade-offs. The two most common
                operations is
                checking if there is an edge between \(v_i\) and \(v_j\) as well as finding all the vertices adjacent to
                a
                vertex \(v_i\)
                <ul>
                    <li>Detecting if edge exists</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adjacency Matrix: O(1). This is because we can directly access the element in the matrix.
                        </li>

                        <li>Adjacency List: O(d) where \(d\) is the maximum degree in the graph. This is because we have
                            to
                            traverse the linked list to find the edge.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Finding all neighbours
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adjacency Matrix: \(O(|V|)\) where \(|V|\) is the number of vertices. This is because we
                            have to
                            traverse the entire row.</li>
                        <li>
                            Adjacency List: \(O(d)\) where \(d\) is the maximum degree in the graph. This is because we
                            have to
                            traverse the linked list to find the edge.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                When \(d\) is much smaller than \(|V|\) it's clear that the adjacency list is more efficient. However,
                when
                \(d\) is close to \(|V|\) then the adjacency matrix is more efficient.<br><br>

                We also have to think about space requirements. An adjacency matrix needs a space of \(O(|V|^2)\)
                because this
                is the number of entries in the matrix.<br><br>

                An adjacency list has a space requirement of \(O(|E| + |V|)\). This is slightly trickier to figure out
                why. This
                is because we want to store a total of \(|V|\) vertices. For each of the \(|V|\) vertices, we want to
                store a
                linked list such that the total number of elements of the lined lists is equal to \(E\) (or \(2E\) for
                an
                undirected graph). Therefore, we have a space requirement of \(O(|E| + |V|)\).
                <h1 id = "L30-pagerank">Pagerank</h1>
                One very notable application of an adjacency matrix is the <b>PageRank</b> algorithm, which is the first and most well-known algorithm used by Google to rank web pages. It essentially tries to capture the idea of which pages are the most important by asking the following question: If I start at a random page and follow random links, what is the probability that I will end up at page \(i\)?
                <ol>
                    <li>Normalize the matrix \(A\) to be
                        \[
                A = \begin{pmatrix}
                0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\ 
                1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
                1 & 0 & 0
                \end{pmatrix}
                \]
                such that each row sums to 1 (i.e. the total probability of ending up at a site when clicking a link is 1).
                    </li>
                    <li>Imagine that we start at state \(v_0\)</li>
                    <li>The probability distribution of reaching some site after a single link click is given by \( M v_0\) where \(M=A^T\). Why is this the case? If the current site is Toronto, then we can write 
                \[
                v_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 \\
                0 \\
                0
                \end{pmatrix}
                \]
                and the (transpose) adjacency matrix \(M=A^T\) maps this vector to the first row of the matrix, which contains all the sites that Toronto links to.<br><br>
                
                In lecture, Professor Guerzhoy wrote \(Av_0\) instead. This gives a different result as the result will be a column that represents the sites that lead to Toronto. For a symmetric adjacency matrix, there is no difference, but in reality, we wouldn't have it to be symmetrical.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Just doing this once is a horrible way of measuring the importance of a site. Someone could cheat the system very easily by creating several sites that all link to the same site. The idea is that if we have a very popular site being linked to by many sites, then many of these sites should also be very popular.<br><br>
                
                        This idea is reflected by iterating the process of multiplying by \(M=A^T\) several times. Suppose we run it \(k\) times, where \(k\) is some very large number. Surprisingly, the result should actually converge! We get 
                        \[
                            (M)^{k} \vec{v}_0 \to \vec{p}
                        \]
                        where \(\vec{p}\) is the probability distribution of reaching any site after \(k\) clicks. This result should not change much depending on what the initial state is (barring some edge cases such as islands), but it is typically done by assuming an initial uniform distribution.<br><br>
                
                        The \(i^\text{th}\) element of \(\vec{p}\) will then be the page rank of the \(i^\text{th}\) site. The intuition is that if we start at a random site and click links, then the probability of ending up at site \(i\) is equal to the page rank of site \(i\).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Why does this work? Why would we even expect the solution to converge at all? The basic idea is that we can decompose \(v_0\) into the eigenvectors \((\vec{w}_1,\vec{w}_2,\dots,\vec{w}_n)\)
                such that 
                \[M^{k}\vec{v}_0 = M^k(a_0\vec{w}_1 + \cdots + a_n\vec{w}_n) = a_1\lambda_1^k \vec{w}_1 + \cdots + a_n\lambda_n^k \vec{w}_n\]
                Suppose \(\vec{w}_1\) has the largest eigenvalue. Then for large \(k\) we have 
                \[M^k\vec{v}_0 \approx a_1\lambda_1^k \vec{w}_1\]
                So we can imagine that if we start at a random site, then the most likely site to end up at is the site with the largest eigenvalue.<br><br>
                
                In fact, it's possible to show (with more linear algebra) that an adjacency matrix where the rows sum to 1 will always have an eigenvalue of \(1\) with a multiplicity of \(1\). In fact, all other eigenvalues will be smaller than \(1\). This shows more clearly that the other eigenvectors will die off quickly as we keep iterating. <i>Note:</i> The above was only used to illustrate the intuition you should have for this kind of problem.<br><br>
                
                There are a couple of flaws with this argument (which we need more math to fix), but if this is something you are interested in, you cover stuff like this (i.e. Markov chains) more in depth in <b>ECE368</b> (and a bit in <b>ROB311</b>) if you decide to do the Machine Intelligence option. <br><br>
                
                Outside of pagerank, this is a very fundamental idea that allows us to see which nodes are connected.
